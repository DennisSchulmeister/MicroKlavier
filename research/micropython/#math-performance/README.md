-> 2 number types (int, float) * 3 execution types (interpreted, native, viper) = 6 runs
-> Each time the same calculations running for the same time
-> Measurement how many calculations can be performed
-> Alternative measurement: How much time for a fixed number to calculations
-> Verify that type annotations don't make a difference for interpreted and native
    -> Only one implementation for int and float needed
-> Stream results as CSV to the serial console for later visaulization
-> Print simple stats at the very end
