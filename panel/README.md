Front panel and graphical display
=================================

This directory contains the source code for the front panel sub-system.
This runs on a separate µC which connects via a serial interface with the
main µC. Its responsibility is to scan the ”tactile user interface” as
well as to provide a “graphical user interface” via an attached display.
